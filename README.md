# bushfire_modelling

Written in May 2019 for Foundations of Computing at the University of Melbourne. 

Bushfires' behaviour are affected by factors such as fuel load, land slope and wind direction, and burning could be prescribed to minimise the fire damage in an actual bushfire. The model simulates the burning of a landscape upon fire ignition and finds the optimal place to perform prescribe burning through:
* Codes that parses a file containing information about the landscape.
* Codes that check if a specific area starts burning at time t+1.
* Codes that simulates the whole burning until all fires stop.
* Codes that determines the optimal place for prescribed burning to occur.

Test cases were also included in the files.
